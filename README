Strategy: 
    1. Given a piece and a board, generate a set of "goal" states for the piece (heuristic: the more empty spaces at the top of the board, the better).
    2. For each goal state, generate a path (using A*) to that goal state (actually, from end state to start state, and then reverse the path).
    3. Repeat 1 and 2 for each piece, building a tree of possible moves.
    4. Prune the tree to keep only the "n" best solutions found so far.

Soooo many hours wasted in bugs where I confuse absolute coordinates with relative coordinates (e.g., 3 moves NW, 2 moves E) on a hex grid.
